Problem Statement:
You are working as a Machine learning Engineer in Tesla as part of the Autonomous driving team focused on building prototype ML model to identify and detect location of:

Traffic Lights, Stop signs
Other Vehicles such as Car, Bicycles, Truck etc
Pedestrian(People)
Animals
on the road in realtime using the Camera installed in the deck of the owners car.

Real time constraints:
Our Object Detection Algorithm needs to be Fast enough to run inference in RealTime on commodity hardware(CPU only) and highly accurate to ensure safety.
Let's see how we can achieve this Balance using new family of Object Detection Algorithms: Single Stage Detectors.
